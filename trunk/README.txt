MiningSuite

Version 0.6 (Sneak Peek version) released on January 28 2014 – in a hurry… – for a demo at AES Semantic Audio conference.
CURRENT STATE: Throughout this month (April 2014), further development of the different modules is progressively integrated in the repository.

MiningSuite is a framework developed within the Matlab environment. It is organized into packages related to signal (SigMinr), auditory (AudMinr), voice (VocMinr), pattern (PatMinr) and music (MusMinr) domains. The MiningSuite features simpler ways of building audio and music analysis processes, using modules that can be thoroughly controlled, with all the model parameters recorded in the output data. A new layer of syntax improves the readability of the modules’ code. Audio and symbolic analyses are unified into a single framework.

The MiningSuite requires Matlab 7.6 (r2008a) or newer versions. It also requires that the Signal Processing Toolbox, one of the optional sub-packages of Matlab, be properly installed. But actually, a certain number of operators can adapt to the absence of this toolbox, and can produce more or less reliable results. But for serious use of the MiningSuite, we strongly recommend a proper installation of the Signal Processing Toolbox.

To use the toolbox, simply add the folder "miningsuite" to your Matlab path.
The list of operators available in the MiningSuite, stored in file Contents.m, can also be displayed by typing "help miningsuite" in Matlab.

A documentation is currently under development in the wiki of the Google Code site of the MiningSuite.
