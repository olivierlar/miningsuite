MiningSuite version 0.6 (Sneak Peek version)

Released on January 28 2014 – in a hurry… – for a demo at AES Semantic Audio conference.

MiningSuite is organized into packages related to signal (SigMinr), auditory (AudMinr), voice (VocMinr), pattern (PatMinr) and music (MusMinr) domains. The MiningSuite features simpler ways of building audio and music analysis processes, using modules that can be thoroughly controlled, with all the model parameters recorded in the output data. A new layer of syntax improves the readability of the modules’ code. Audio and symbolic analyses are unified into a single framework.
