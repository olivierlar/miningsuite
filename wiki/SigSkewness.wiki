#summary sig.skewness: Skewness of the data

= sig.skewness: Statistical description of spectral distribution =

`sig.skewness` returns the coefficient of skewness of the data.

The third central moment is called the skewness and is a measure of the symmetry of the distribution. The skewness can have a positive value in which case the distribution is said to be positively skewed with a few values much larger than the mean and therefore a long tail to the right. A negatively skewed distribution has a longer tail to the left. A symmetrical distribution has a skewness of zero. (Koch)

The coefficient of skewness is the ratio of the skewness to the standard deviation raised to the third power.

The coefficient of skewness has more convenient units than does the skewness and often ranges from -3.0 to 3.0 for data from natural systems. Again, a symmetrical distribution has a coefficient of skewness of zero. A positive coefficient of skewness often indicates that the distribution exhibits a concentration of mass toward the left and a long tail to the right whereas a negative value generally indicates the opposite.

== Flowchart Interconnections ==

`sig.skewness` accepts either:
  * `sig.spectrum` objects<p>
  * `sig.input` objects (same as for `sig.spectrum`)<p>
  * file name(s) or the `'Folder'` keyword. 
<br>

== Frame decomposition ==

`'Frame'` performs first a frame decomposition, with by default a frame length of 50 ms and half overlapping. For the specification of other frame configuration using additional parameters, cf. the previous SigFrame vs. 'Frame' section.
<br><br>

== Inputs ==

Any data can be used as input.

If the input is an audio waveform, a file name, or the `'Folder'` keyword, the skewness is computed on the spectrum (spectral skewness).

If the input is a series of peak lobes produced by `sig.peaks(â€¦,'Extract')`, the skewness will be computed for each of these lobes separately.
