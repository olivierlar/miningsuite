When `mus.score` is called with the option `'Group'`, local grouping is performed.

For the moment, only local grouping in the time domain have been conceived and integrated to the module.

In the time domain, local grouping aggregates in a purely hierarchical fashion. Each group is characterized by the maximal temporal distance between successive notes. Smaller groups are related to short temporal distances while larger group that contains other groups are related to longer temporal distances.

Let's analyse this French folk song, called "Au clair de la lune":

Below is the local grouping, obtained using the command:
{{{
mus.score('auclairdelalune.mid','Group','Spell')

The piece starts with four eighth-notes followed by a fourth-note. These first 5 notes (with successive pitches C,C,C,D,E) form a local group related to the rhythmic value of eighth-note. This 5-note local group is followed by an isolated fourth-note (D) and a second 5-note local group (C,E,D,D,C). Since these 11 notes end with a half-note, they form altogether a higher-level local group related to the rhythmic value of fourth-note. The grouping is the same for the three other phrases, as they present the same rhythmic configuration.

== Local group head ==

By definition, a time-based local group terminates with a note that is followed by a duration (before the next note) that is significantly longer than the temporal distance between notes within the group. As such, the local group can be perceived as a phrase that terminates with a concluding note that has a more structural importance. This hypothesis might not be always valid, in particular in the presence of particular accentuations at particular notes within the group. But in more general case, it seems to offer some general interest. Following this observation, we propose to formalize this hierarchy of notes in local groups by associating with each local group a main note, or “head” to follow the GTTM's Time-Span Reduction terminology, which would in the simple case be the last note of the group, circled in red in the score representation. The other notes can be considered as “subordinate events” or – why not – as the “tail” of the group.

Local group head is shown with a red line that spans from the attack of the note to the end of the local group.

For instance, in the example above, the first 5-note local group (C,C,C,D,E) terminates with the longer note E, becoming the head of the group.
