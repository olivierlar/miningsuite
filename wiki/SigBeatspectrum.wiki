#summary sig.beatspectrum: Beat spectrum

= sig.beatspectrum: Beat spectrum =

The beat spectrum has been proposed as a measure of acoustic self-similarity as a function of time lag, and is computed from the similarity matrix (cf. SigSimatrix) (Foote, Cooper and Nam, 2002).

== Flowchart Interconnections ==

One parameter related to `sig.simatrix` is accessible in `sig.beatspectrum`:
  * 'Distance'.
<br>
`sig.beatspectrum` accepts either:
  * `sig.simatrix` objects,<p>
  * `sig.spectrum` frame-decomposed objects,<p>
  * `sig.input` objects: in this case, the similarity matrix will be based on the mfcc (`sig.mfcc`), computed from ranks 8 to 33. The audio waveform is decomposed into frames if it was not decomposed yet<p>
  * file name(s) or the `'Folder'` keyword: same behavior as for `sig.input` objects,<p>
  * other frame-decomposed analysis.
<br>
`sig.beatspectrum` can return several outputs:

  # the beat spectrum curve itself, and<p>
  # the similarity matrix (`sig.simatrix`).

== Frame decomposition ==
`sig.beatspectrum(…,'Frame',…)` specifies the frame configuration, with by default a frame length of 25 ms and a hop factor of 10 ms. For the specification of other frame configuration using additional parameters, cf. the previous SigFrame vs. 'Frame' section.
