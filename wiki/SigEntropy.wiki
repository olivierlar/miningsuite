#summary sig.entropy: Relative entropy of the data

= sig.entropy: Relative entropy of the data =

`sig.entropy` returns the relative Shannon (1948) entropy of the input. The Shannon entropy, used in information theory, is based on the following equation:

where _b_ is the base of the logarithm.

In order to obtain a measure of entropy that is independent on the sequence length, `sig.entropy` actually returns the relative entropy, computed as follows:

Shannon entropy offers a general description of the input curve _p_, and indicates in particular whether it contains predominant peaks or not. Indeed, if the curve is extremely flat, corresponding to a situation of maximum uncertainty concerning the output of the random variable _X_ of probability mass function _p(xi)_, then the entropy is maximal. Reversely, if the curve displays only one very sharp peak, above a flat and low background, then the entropy is minimal, indicating a situation of minimum uncertainty as the output will be entirely governed by that peak.

The equation of Shannon entropy can only be applied to functions _p(xi)_ that follow the characteristics of a probability mass function: all the values must be non-negative and sum up to 1. Inputs of `sig.entropy` are transformed in order to respect these constraints:

  * The non-negative values are replaced by zeros (i.e., half-wave rectification).<p>
  * The remaining data is scaled such that it sums up to 1.

== Flowchart Interconnections ==

`sig.entropy` accepts either:
  * `sig.spectrum` objects<p>
  * `sig.input` objects (same as for `sig.spectrum`)<p>
  * file name(s) or the `'Folder'` keyword. 
<br>

== Frame decomposition ==

`'Frame'` performs first a frame decomposition, with by default a frame length of 50 ms and half overlapping. For the specification of other frame configuration using additional parameters, cf. the previous SigFrame vs. 'Frame' section.

<br>
== Inputs ==
Any data can be used as input.

If the input is an audio waveform, a file name, or the `'Folder'` keyword, the entropy is computed on the spectrum (spectral entropy).

<br>
== Options ==
  * `sig.entropy(…,'Center')` centers the input data before half-wave rectification.<p>
  * `sig.entropy(…,'MinRMS',`_m_`)`, when the input is an audio waveform, a spectrum or a cepstrum, specifies the threshold _m_, as a value from 0 to 1, for the detection of quasi-silent frames, for which no value is given. For a given frame, if the RMS of the input (for spectral entropy, the input is each frame of the spectrogram, etc.) is below _m_ times the highest RMS value over the frames, NaN is returned. default value: _m_ = .005
