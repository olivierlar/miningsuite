#summary sig.attacktime: Attack phase detection

= sig.attacktime: Attack phase detection =

The attack phase detected using the `'Attacks'` option in `sig.onsets` can offer some timbral characterizations. One simple way of describing the attack phase, proposed in `sig.attacktime`, consists in estimating its temporal duration.

== Flowchart Interconnections ==

`sig.attacktime` accepts as input data type either:

  * onset detection curves (resulting from `sig.onsets`), already including peaks or not,<p>
  * and all the input data accepted by `sig.onsets`. In this case `sig.onsets` is called with the `'Filter'` method.

<br>
`sig.onsets` is normalized using the `'Normal'` option set to `'AcrossSegments'`.
<br><br>

Some options in `sig.onsets` can be controlled:
  * `sig.attacktime(…,'Single')` toggles on the `'Single'` option in `sig.onsets`.<p>
  * `sig.attacktime(…,'LogOnset')` toggles on the `'Log'` option in `sig.onsets`.<p>
  * `sig.attacktime(…,'MinLog',`_ml_`)` controls the `'MinLog'` option in `sig.onsets`.

<br>
`sig.attacktime` can return several outputs:
  # the attack time itself and<p>
  ## the onset detection curve returned by `sig.onsets`, including the detected onsets.

== Options ==

`sig.attacktime(…,`_scale_`)` specifies the output scale, linear or logarithmic. Possible values for _scale_ are:<p>
  * _scale_ = `'Lin'` returns the duration in a linear scale (in seconds). (Default choice)<p>
  * _scale_ = `'Log'` returns the duration in a log scale (Krimphoff et al., 1994).
