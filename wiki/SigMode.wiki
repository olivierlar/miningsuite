#summary sig.mode: Modality estimation

= sig.mode: Modality estimation =

Estimates the modality, i.e. major vs. minor, returned as a numerical value between -1 and +1: the closer it is to +1, the more major the given excerpt is predicted to be, the closer the value is to -1, the more minor the excerpt might be.

== Flowchart Interconnections ==

mirmode accepts either:
  * mirkeystrength objects, where peaks have been already extracted or not,<p>
  * mirchromagram objects,<p>
  * mirspectrum objects,<p>
  * sig.input objects (same as for mirkey) or<p>
  * file name(s) or the ‘Folder’ keyword.
<br>
mirmode can return several outputs:
  # modality itself, and<p>
  ## the mirkeystrength result used for the computation of modality.

<br>
== Frame decomposition ==
mirmode(...,‘Frame’,...) performs first a frame decomposition, with by default a frame length of 1 s and a hop factor of 50% (0.5 s). For the specification of other frame configuration using additional parameters, cf. the previous SigFrame vs. ‘Frame’ section.

<br>
== Strategies ==
  * mirmode(...,‘Best’) computes the key strength difference between the best major key (highest key strength value) and the best minor key (lowest key strength value). (default choice)<p>

  * mirmode(...,‘Sum’) sums up the key strength differences between all the major keys and their relative minor keys.
