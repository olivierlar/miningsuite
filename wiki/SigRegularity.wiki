#summary sig.regularity: Spectral peaks variability

= sig.regularity: Spectral peaks variability =

The irregularity of a spectrum is the degree of variation of the successive peaks of the spectrum.
<br><br>

== Flowchart Interconnections ==

The `'Contrast'` parameter associated to `sig.peaks` can be specified, and is set by default to .01

`sig.regularity` accepts either:

  * `sig.spectrum` objects, where peaks have already been picked or not,<p>
  * `sig.input` objects (same as for `sig.spectrum`),<p>
  * file name(s) or the `'Folder'` keyword.
<br>

== Frame decomposition ==

`sig.regularity(…,'Frame',…)` performs first a frame decomposition, with by default a frame length of 50 ms and half overlapping. For the specification of other frame configuration using additional parameters, cf. the previous SigFrame vs. 'Frame' section.

== Options ==

  * `sig.regularity(…,'Jensen')` is based on (Jensen, 1999), where the irregularity is the sum of the square of the difference in amplitude between adjoining partials.(Default approach)<p> https://miningsuite.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/SigRegularity_eq1.png<p>
  * `sig.regularity(…,'Krimphoff')` is based on (Krimphoff et al., 1994), where the irregularity is the sum of the amplitude minus the mean of the preceding, same and next amplitude.<p>https://miningsuite.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/SigRegularity_eq2.png
