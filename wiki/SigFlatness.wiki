#summary sig.flatness: Flatness of the data

= sig.flatness: Flatness of the data =

`sig.flatness` returns the flatness of the data.

The flatness indicates whether the distribution is smooth or spiky, and results from the simple ratio between the geometric mean and the arithmetic mean:

== Flowchart Interconnections ==

`sig.flatness` accepts either:
  * `sig.spectrum` objects<p>
  * `sig.input` objects (same as for `sig.spectrum`)<p>
  * file name(s) or the `'Folder'` keyword. 

<br>
== Frame decomposition ==

`'Frame'` performs first a frame decomposition, with by default a frame length of 50 ms and half overlapping. For the specification of other frame configuration using additional parameters, cf. the previous SigFrame vs. 'Frame' section.

<br>
== Inputs ==

Any data can be used as input.

If the input is an audio waveform, a file name, or the `'Folder'` keyword, the flatness is computed on the spectrum (spectral flatness).

<br>
== Options ==

`sig.flatness(â€¦,'MinRMS',`_m_`)` specifies the threshold _m_, as a value from 0 to 1, for the detection of quasi-silent frames, for which no value is given. For a given frame, if the RMS of the input (for spectral flatness, the input is each frame of the spectrogram, etc.) is below _m_ times the highest RMS value over the frames, NaN is returned. default value: _m_ = .01
