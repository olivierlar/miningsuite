#summary sig.tonalcentroid: 6-dimensional tonal centroid vector

= sig.tonalcentroid: 6-dimensional tonal centroid vector =

Calculates the 6-dimensional tonal centroid vector from the chromagram. It corresponds to a projection of the chords along circles of fifths, of minor thirds, and of major thirds (Harte and Sandler, 2006).

== Flowchart Interconnections ==

`sig.tonalcentroid` accepts either:
  * `sig.chromagram` objects,<p>
  * `sig.spectrum` objects,<p>
  * `sig.input` objects , where the audio waveform can be segmented (using `sig.segment`), decomposed into channels (using `sig.filterbank`), and/or decomposed into frames (using `sig.frame`),<p>
  * file name(s) or the `'Folder'` keyword.

<br>
`sig.tonalcentroid` can return several outputs:
  # the tonal centroid itself, and<p>
  ## the `sig.chromagram` data.

<br>
== Frame decomposition ==
`sig.tonalcentroid(…,'Frame',…)` performs first a frame decomposition, with by default a frame length of 743 ms and a hop factor of 10% (74.3 ms). For the specification of other frame configuration using additional parameters, cf. the previous SigFrame vs. 'Frame' section. 

<br>
== Accessible Output ==
cf. §5.2 for an explanation of the use of the `'get'` method. Specific fields:
  * `'Dimensions'`: the index of the 6 dimensions (same as `'Pos'`),<p>
  * `'Positions'`: the position of each data within the 6-dimensional space (same as `'Data'`).
