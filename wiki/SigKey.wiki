#summary sig.key: Tonal center estimation

= sig.key: Tonal center estimation =

Gives a broad estimation of tonal center positions and their respective clarity.

<br>
== Flowchart Interconnections ==

It consists simply of a peak picking in the mirkeystrength curve(s). Two options of mirpeaks are accessible from mirkey:
  * ‘Total’, set to 1<p>
  * ‘Contrast’, set to .1
<br>
The ‘Weight’ and ‘Triangle’ options used in mirchromagram can be changed directly in mirkeystrength.

<br>
mirkey accepts either: 
  * mirkeystrength objects, where peaks have been already extracted or not,<p>
  * mirchromagram objects,<p>
  * mirspectrum objects,<p>
  * sig.input objects , where the audio waveform can be segmented (using mirsegment), decomposed into channels (using mirfilterbank), and/or decomposed into frames (using mirframe or the ‘Frame’ option, with by default a frame length of 1 s and half overlapping),<p>
  * file name(s) or the ‘Folder’ keyword.

<br>
mirkey can return several outputs:
  # the best key(s), i.e., the peak abscissa(e);<p>
  ## the key clarity: i.e., the key strength associated to the best key(s), i.e., the peak ordinate(s);<p>
  ## the mirkeystrength data including the picked peaks (mirpeaks).

<br>
== Frame decomposition ==

mirkey(...,‘Frame’,...) performs first a frame decomposition, with by default a frame length of 1 s and a hop factor of 50% (0.5 s). For the specification of other frame configuration using additional parameters, cf. the previous mirframe vs. ‘Frame’ section.

== Example ==
{{{
[k c s]=mirkey(‘ragtime','Frame')
