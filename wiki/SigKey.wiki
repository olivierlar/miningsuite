#summary sig.key: Tonal center estimation

= sig.key: Tonal center estimation =

Gives a broad estimation of tonal center positions and their respective clarity.

== Flowchart Interconnections ==

It consists simply of a peak picking in the `sig.keystrength` curve(s). Two options of `sig.peaks` are accessible from `sig.key`:
  * `'Total'`, set to 1<p>
  * `'Contrast'`, set to .1
<br>
The `'Weight'` and `'Triangle'` options used in `sig.chromagram` can be changed directly in `sig.keystrength`.

<br>
`sig.key` accepts either: 
  * `sig.keystrength` objects, where peaks have been already extracted or not,<p>
  * `sig.chromagram` objects,<p>
  * `sig.spectrum` objects,<p>
  * `sig.input` objects , where the audio waveform can be segmented (using `sig.segment`), decomposed into channels (using `sig.filterbank`), and/or decomposed into frames (using `sig.frame` or the `'Frame'` option, with by default a frame length of 1 s and half overlapping),<p>
  * file name(s) or the `'Folder'` keyword.

<br>
`sig.key` can return several outputs:
  # the best key(s), i.e., the peak abscissa(e);<p>
  ## the key clarity: i.e., the key strength associated to the best key(s), i.e., the peak ordinate(s);<p>
  ## the `sig.keystrength` data including the picked peaks (sig.peaks).

<br>
== Frame decomposition ==

`sig.key(…,'Frame',…)` performs first a frame decomposition, with by default a frame length of 1 s and a hop factor of 50% (0.5 s). For the specification of other frame configuration using additional parameters, cf. the previous SigFrame vs. 'Frame' section.

== Example ==
{{{
[k c s]=sig.key('ragtime','Frame')
}}}
