#summary sig.fluctuation: Rhythmic periodicity along auditory channels

= sig.fluctuation: Rhythmic periodicity along auditory channels =

One way of estimating the rhythmic is based on spectrogram computation transformed by auditory modeling and then a spectrum estimation in each band (Pampalk et al., 2002).
The implementation proposed in MiningSuite includes a subset of the series of operations proposed in Pampalk et al.:

1. First a power spectrogram is computed

  * on frames of 23 ms with a hop rate _hr_, set by default to 80 Hz, but is automatically raised to the double of the maximum fluctuation frequency range _m_, used in step 2.

  * The Terhardt outer ear modeling is computed.

  * A multi-band redistribution of the energy is performed along the 'Bark' bands decomposition. 
   * `sig.fluctuation(…,'Mel')`  performs a decomposition into 40 Mel bands instead of 20 Bark bands. 

  * Masking effects are estimated on the multi-band distribution.

  * Finally the amplitudes are represented in dB scale.

This is summarized in one MiningSuite command line:
{{{
s=sig.spectrum(…,'Frame',.023,'s',hr,'Hz',…
  'Power','Terhardt',b,'Mask','dB')
}}}

where _b_ is either 'Bark' or 'Mel'.


2. Then a FFT is computed on each band:
  * Frequencies range from 0 to m Hz, where m is set by default to 10 Hz can be controlled by a `'Max'` option:<br>`sig.fluctuation(…,'Max',`_m_`)`

  * The frequency resolution of the FFT mr is set by default to .01 Hz and can also be controlled by a `'MinRes'` option:<br>`sig.fluctuation(…,'MinRes',`_mr_`)`

  * The amplitude modulation coefficients are weighted based on the psychoacoustic model of the fluctuation strength (Fastl, 1982).

This is summarized in one MiningSuite command line:
{{{
f = sig.spectrum(s,'AlongBands','Max',m,'MinRes',mr,'Window',0,…
  'Resonance','Fluctuation','NormalLength')
}}}

We can see in the matrix the rhythmic periodicities for each different Bark band.

3. `sig.fluctuation(…,'Summary')` subsequently sums the resulting spectrum across bands, leading to a spectrum summary, showing the global repartition of rhythmic periodicities:
{{{
sig.sum(f)
}}}


== Flowchart Interconnections ==

  * `sig.fluctuation` accepts as input data type either:

  * `sig.spectrum` frame-decomposed objects (i.e., spectrograms),

  * `sig.input` objects, where the audio waveform can be segmented (using `sig.segment`). The audio waveform is decomposed into frames if it was not decomposed yet.

  * file name(s) or the `'Folder'` keyword: same behavior than for `sig.input` objects.


== Frame decomposition ==

  * `sig.fluctuation(…,'InnerFrame',`_l_`,`_r_`)` specifies the spectrogram frame length _l_ (in second), and, optionally, the frame rate _r_ (in Hertz), with by default a frame length of 23 ms and a frame rate of 80 Hz.

  * `sig.fluctuation(…,'Frame',`_l_`,`_h_`)` computes fluctuation using a window moving along the spectrogram, whose length _l_ (in second) and frame rate _r_ (in Hertz) can be specified as well, with by default a frame length of 1 s and a frame rate of 10 Hz.
