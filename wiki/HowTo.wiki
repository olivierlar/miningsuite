= How to use the _MiningSuite_? =

Download the latest public version of MiningSuite, available at the project home page:
https://code.google.com/p/miningsuite/
under the paragraph "Releases".

The _MiningSuite_ requires _Matlab_ 7.6 (r2008a) or newer versions. However version 8.2 (r2013b) or newer is strongly recommended, because _MiningSuite_ easily crashes on previous versions.

The _MiningSuite_ also requires that the _Signal Processing Toolbox_, one of the optional sub-packages of _Matlab_, be properly installed. But actually, a certain number of operators can adapt to the absence of this toolbox, and can produce more or less reliable results. But for serious use of the _MiningSuite_, we strongly recommend a proper installation of the _Signal Processing Toolbox_.

To use the toolbox, simply add the folder `miningsuite` to your _Matlab_ path.

The list of operators available in the _MiningSuite_, stored in file `Contents.m`, can also be displayed by typing *`help miningsuite`* in _Matlab_.

Examples of what you can try for the moment can be found in the wikipage UsageTxt.
