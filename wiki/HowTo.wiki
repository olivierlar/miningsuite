= How to use the _MiningSuite_? =

The _MiningSuite_ requires _Matlab_ 7.6 (r2008a) or newer versions. It also requires that the _Signal Processing Toolbox_, one of the optional sub-packages of _Matlab_, be properly installed. But actually, a certain number of operators can adapt to the absence of this toolbox, and can produce more or less reliable results. But for serious use of the _MiningSuite_, we strongly recommend a proper installation of the _Signal Processing Toolbox_.

To use the toolbox, simply add the folder `miningsuite` to your _Matlab_ path.

The list of operators available in the _MiningSuite_, stored in file `Contents.m`, can also be displayed by typing *`help miningsuite`* in _Matlab_.
