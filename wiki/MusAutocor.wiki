#summary mus.autocor: Music-theoretical representation of autocorrelation function

= mus.autocor: Music-theoretical representation of autocorrelation function =

This operations is a specialisation of the general signal processing operator [SigAutocor sig.autocor] focused on music theory.

Same as in [SigAutocor sig.autocor].

== Post-processing ==

  * `mus.autocor(…,'Resonance',`_r_`)` multiplies the autocorrelation curve with a resonance curve that emphasizes pulsations that are more easily perceived. Two resonance curves are proposed:
   * _r_ = `'ToiviainenSnyder'` (Toiviainen & Snyder 2003) (default value if `'Resonance'` option toggled on),
   * _r_ = `'vanNoorden'` (van Noorden & Moelants, 1999).<p>
   This option should be used only when the input of the `sig.autocor` function is an amplitude envelope, i.e., a `´sig.envelope´` object.<p>
