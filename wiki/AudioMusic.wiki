#summary Guided Tour: Audio-based music analysis

= Guided Tour: Audio-based music analysis =

This is a part of the MiningSuite GuidedTour.

== Non music-specific analyses ==

First of all, have a look at the audio-based method that were not conceived for music in the first place, but that can be of high interest anyway: So please take the SignalTour.

== Tempo estimation ==

{{{
t = mus.tempo('ragtime.wav')
t.getdata
}}}
Estimates tempo.

{{{
t = mus.tempo('ragtime.wav','FrameSize',2)
}}}

{{{
mus.tempo('laksin.mid')
}}}
Estimates tempo from a MIDI file, using the same audio-based method as for the audio file.
