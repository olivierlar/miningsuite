#summary sig.brightness: High-frequency energy (II)

= sig.brightness: High-frequency energy (II) =

A dual method consists in fixing this time the cut-off frequency, and measuring the amount of energy above that frequency (Juslin, 2000). The result is expressed as a number between 0 and 1.

== Flowchart Interconnections ==

`sig.brightness` accepts either:
  * `sig.spectrum` objects, or<p>
  * `sig.input` objects (same as for `sig.spectrum`).<p>
  * file name(s) or the `‘Folder’` keyword.
<br>

== Frame decomposition ==

`mirbrightness(..., ‘Frame’, ...)` performs first a frame decomposition, with by default a frame length of 50 ms and half overlapping. For the specification of other frame configuration using additional parameters, cf. the previous SigFrame vs. ‘Frame’ section.
<br><br>

== Options ==

  * `mirbrightness(...,'CutOff’,`_f_`)` specifies the frequency cut-off, in Hz. Default value: 1500 Hz. The value 1000 Hz has been proposed in (Laukka, Juslin and Bresin, 2005), and the value of 3000 Hz has been proposed in (Juslin, 2000).<p>
  * `mirbrightness(...,‘MinRMS’,`_m_`)` specifies the threshold _m_, as a value from 0 to 1, for the detection of quasi-silent frames, for which no value is given. For a given frame, if the RMS of the input spectrogram is below m times the highest RMS value over the frames, NaN is returned. default value: _m_ = .005
