#summary sig.hdcf: Harmonic Change Detection Function

= sig.hdcf: Harmonic Change Detection Function =

The Harmonic Change Detection Function (HCDF) is the flux of the tonal centroid (Harte and Sandler, 2006).

== Flowchart Interconnections ==

`mirhcdf` accepts either:
  * `mirtonalcentroid` frame-decomposed objects,<p>
  * `mirchromagram` frame-decomposed objects,<p>
  * `mirspectrum` frame-decomposed objects,<p>
  * `sig.input` objects , where the audio waveform can be segmented (using `mirsegment`), decomposed into channels (using `mirfilterbank`). If not decomposed yet, it is decomposed into frames (using the `'Frame'` option, with by default a frame length of .743 s and a hop factor of .1),<p>
  * file name(s) or the `'Folder'` keyword.

== Frame decomposition ==

`mirhcdf(…,'Frame',…)` performs first a frame decomposition, with by default a frame length of 743 ms and a hop factor of 10% (74.3 ms). For the specification of other frame configuration using additional parameters, cf. the previous SigFrame vs. 'Frame' section.
