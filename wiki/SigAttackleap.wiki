#summary sig.attackleap: estimating amplitude differences of the attack phase

= sig.attackleap: estimating amplitude differences of the attack phase =

Another simple way of describing the attack phase, proposed in `sig.attackleap`, consists in estimating the amplitude difference between the beginning and the end of the attack phase. Values are expressed in the same scale than the original signal.

== Flowchart Interconnections ==

`sig.attackleap` accepts as input data type either:
  * onset detection curves (resulting from `sig.onsets`), already including peaks or not,<p>
  * and all the input data accepted by `sig.onsets`. In this case `sig.onsets` is called with the `'Filter'` method.
<br>
`sig.onsets` is normalized using the `'Normal'` option set to `'AcrossSegments'`.
<br><br>

Some options in `sig.onsets` can be controlled:

  * `sig.attackleap(…,'Single')` toggles on the `'Single'` option in `sig.onsets`.<p>
  * `sig.attackleap(…,'LogOnset')` toggles on the `'Log'` option in `sig.onsets`.<p>
  * `sig.attackleap(…,'MinLog',`_ml_`)` controls the `'MinLog'` option in `sig.onsets`.

<br>
The peak picking from the onset detection is performed in any case. Its `'Contrast'` parameter can be specified. Its default value is the same as in `sig.onsets`.

<br>
`sig.attackleap` can return several outputs:
  # the attack leap itself and<p>
  ## the onset detection curve returned by `sig.onsets`, including the detected onsets.
