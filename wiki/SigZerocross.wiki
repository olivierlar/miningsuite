#summary sig.zerocross: Waveform sign-change rate

= sig.zerocross: Waveform sign-change rate =

A simple indicator of noisiness consists in counting the number of times the signal crosses the X-axis (or, in other words, changes sign).

== Flowchart Interconnections ==

`sig.zerocross` actually accepts any input data type (cf. section 4.2).
<br><br>

== Frame decomposition ==

`sig.zerocross(…,'Frame',…)` performs first a frame decomposition, with by default a frame length of 50 ms and half overlapping. For the specification of other frame configuration using additional parameters, cf. the previous SigFrame vs. 'Frame' section.

== Options ==

  * `sig.zerocross(…,'Per',`_p_`)` precises the temporal reference for the rate computation. Possible values:
   * _p_ = `'Second'`: number of sign-changes per second (Default).
   * _p_ = `'Sample'`: number of sign-changes divided by the total  number of samples. The `'Second'` option returns a result equal to the one returned by the `'Sample'` option multiplied by the sampling rate.<p>
  * `sig.zerocross(…,'Dir',`_d_`)` precises the definition of sign change. Possible values:
   * _d_ = `'One'`: number of sign-changes from negative to positive only (or, equivalently, from positive to negative only). (Default)
   * _d_ = `'Both'`: number of sign-changes in both ways. The `'Both'` option returns a result equal to twice the one returned by the `'One'` option.
