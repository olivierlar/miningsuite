#summary sig.zerocross: Waveform sign-change rate

= sig.zerocross: Waveform sign-change rate =

A simple indicator of noisiness consists in counting the number of times the signal crosses the X-axis (or, in other words, changes sign).

== Flowchart Interconnections ==

mirzerocross actually accepts any input data type (cf. section 4.2).
<br><br>

== Frame decomposition ==

mirzerocross(..., ‘Frame’, ...) performs first a frame decomposition, with by default a frame length of 50 ms and half overlapping. For the specification of other frame configuration using additional parameters, cf. the previous mirframe vs. ‘Frame’ section.

== Options ==

  * mirzerocross(..., ‘Per’, p) precises the temporal reference for the rate computation. Possible values:
   * p = ‘Second’: number of sign-changes per second (Default).
   * p = ‘Sample’: number of sign-changes divided by the total  number of samples. The ‘Second’ option returns a result equal to the one returned by the ‘Sample’ option multiplied by the sampling rate.<p>
  * mirzerocross(..., ‘Dir’, d) precises the definition of sign change. Possible values:
   * d = ‘One’: number of sign-changes from negative to positive only (or, equivalently, from positive to negative only). (Default)
   * d = 'Both': number of sign-changes in both ways. The 'Both' option returns a result equal to twice the one returned by the 'One’ option.
