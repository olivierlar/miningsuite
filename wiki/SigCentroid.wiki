#summary sig.centroid: Statistical description of spectral distribution

= sig.centroid: Statistical description of spectral distribution =

The spectral distribution can be described by statistical moments: centroid, spread, skewness, kurtosis, flatness as well as by entropy.<p>
See the Statistics section (ยง4.2) for more details about each operator.

== Flowchart Interconnections ==

`sig.centroid` accepts either:
  * `sig.spectrum` objects<p>
  * `sig.input` objects (same as for `sig.spectrum`)<p>
  * file name(s) or the `'Folder'` keyword. 
<br>

== Frame decomposition ==

`'Frame'` performs first a frame decomposition, with by default a frame length of 50 ms and half overlapping. For the specification of other frame configuration using additional parameters, cf. the previous SigFrame vs. 'Frame' section.

== Options ==

See the Statistics section (ยง4.2) for more details about the operator.
