#summary sig.sum: Summation of filterbank channels

= sig.sum: Summation of filterbank channels =

Once an audio waveform is decomposed into channels using a filterbank:
{{{
f = sig.filterbank(a)
}}}

An envelope extraction, for instance, can be computed using this very simple syntax:
{{{
e = sig.envelope(f)
}}}

Then the channels can be summed back using the mirsum command:
{{{
s = sig.sum(e)
}}}

The summation can be centered using the command:
{{{
s = sig,sum(..., ‘Center’)
}}}

The summation can be divided by the number of channels using the command:
{{{
s = sig.sum(..., ‘Mean’)
}}}

== Summary of filterbank channels ==
If we compute for instance an autocorrelation from the envelopes:
{{{
ac = sig.autocor(e)
}}}

Then we can sum all the autocorrelation using exactly the same mirsum command:
{{{
s = sig.sum(e)
}}}

This summation of non-temporal signals across channels is usually called _summary_.
