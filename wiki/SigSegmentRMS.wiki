#summary sig.segment(…,'RMS')

= sig.segment(…,'RMS') =

Segmentation at positions of long silences. A frame decomposed RMS is computed using sig.rms (with default options), and segments are selected from temporal positions where the RMS rises to a given `'On'` threshold, until temporal positions where the RMS drops back to a given `'Off'` threshold.

== Options ==

  * `sig.segment(…,'Off',`_t1_`)` specifies the RMS `'Off'` threshold. Default value: _t1_ = .01<p>
  * `sig.segment(…,'On',`_t2_`)` specifies the RMS `'On'` threshold. Default value: _t2_ = .02

== Flowchart Interconnections ==

`sig.segment` accepts uniquely as main input a miraudio objects not frame-decomposed, not channel decomposed, and not already segmented. Alternatively, file name or the `'Folder'` keyword can be used as well.

`sig.segment(…,'RMS')` can return several outputs:

  * the segmented audio waveform itself,<p>
  * the RMS curve (`sig.rms`).
