#summary sig.segment(…,'RMS')

= sig.segment(…,'RMS') =

Segmentation at positions of long silences. A frame decomposed RMS is computed using sig.rms (with default options), and segments are selected from temporal positions where the RMS rises to a given `'On'` threshold, until temporal positions where the RMS drops back to a given `'Off'` threshold.

== Options ==

sig.segment(...,‘Off’, t1) specifies the RMS ‘Off’ threshold. Default value: t1 = .01
sig.segment(...,‘On’, t2) specifies the RMS ‘On’ threshold. Default value: t2 = .02

== Flowchart Interconnections ==

sig.segment accepts uniquely as main input a miraudio objects not frame-decomposed, not channel decomposed, and not already segmented. Alternatively, file name or the `'Folder'` keyword can be used as well.

sig.segment(..., ‘RMS’) can return several outputs:

  * the segmented audio waveform itself,

  * the RMS curve (`sig.rms`).
